# dinobar

Because the Touch Bar clearly wasn't useless enough already.

## What Is This?

**DinoBar** is a _totally necessary_, _absolutely mission-critical_ clone of the classic Chrome Dino game... but for your **MacBook Pro Touch Bar**. Yep, that strip of OLED real estate you only ever accidentally tap while trying to press Esc? It plays a dinosaur game now.

And before you ask: yes, this README was _generated with AI_. Because typing is hard, and sarcasm is a service.

## Why?

Great question.

We could've cured cancer.  
We could've solved climate change.  
Instead, we made a dinosaur jump on a 2170 x 60 pixel strip of OLED. You're welcome.

## Features

- Tiny dino.
- Tiny cacti.
- Even tinier regrets.
- Fully optimized for the 1% of your MacBook that's _least relevant to productivity_.
- No internet required — just like the original, but worse!

## Controls

Tap the Touch Bar to jump.
That’s it. There is no step 2.

## Why have a README

I added a README because people said my other touchbar project didn't have one.
